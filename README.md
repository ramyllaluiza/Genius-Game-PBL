- PBL Projects – SystemVerilog | Vivado (Linux)
This repository contains a collection of Project-Based Learning (PBL) activities developed during my academic coursework, using SystemVerilog within the Vivado environment on Linux. Each PBL tackles a specific phase of the digital design and verification flow, from RTL development to physical prototyping.

- Projects List
PBL01 – RTL Design Using Finite State Machines (FSM)

PBL02 – RISC-V Machine Code Implementation

PBL03 – RISC-V Processor Verification Using UVM

PBL04 – Design Synthesis, Static Timing Analysis (STA) & FPGA Prototyping

- About
The goal of this repository is to document and demonstrate the practical application of digital design principles using SystemVerilog and industry-standard tools. Each project simulates a real-world design scenario and represents a complete step in the development and verification of a RISC-V-based digital system.

- Tools & Technologies
Language: SystemVerilog

Simulation: Vivado Simulator

Design Tool: Vivado (Linux version)

Verification Methodology: UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)

Target Architecture: RISC-V (subset of the ISA)
