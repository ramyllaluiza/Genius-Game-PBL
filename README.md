PBL Projects – SystemVerilog | Vivado (Linux)
This repository contains a collection of Project-Based Learning (PBL) activities developed as part of my course using SystemVerilog in the Vivado environment (Linux version). Each PBL addresses a specific stage in the design and verification flow of digital systems, from RTL development to physical prototyping.

📚 Projects List
PBL01 – RTL Design Using FSM
PBL02 – RISC-V Machine Code Implementation
PBL03 – RISC-V Processor UVM Verification
PBL04 – Design Synthesis, STA and Prototyping
💡 About
The purpose of this repository is to document and demonstrate the practical application of digital design concepts through SystemVerilog and industry-standard tools. Each project represents a step in the full development and verification flow of a RISC-V-based digital system.
